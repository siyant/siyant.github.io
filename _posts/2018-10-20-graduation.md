My SUTD journey has officially ended as of September, with a Bachelor of Engineering in ISTD (summa cum laude)! Time flies although honestly, towards the end I felt like I was just waiting for the weeks to pass before I could take my final exams and go for my grad trip. These three and a half years have been... I can't think of one adjective to describe everything LOL, I guess I'll say that it has been filled with memories. Mostly good ones, but there are some things I could've done better too. Had lots of fun times with my freshman class, during my exchange in Hangzhou, chionging projects together and cycling out for dinner/supper on random days, among many other things. 

Academics wise, I wouldn't say that all the mods I took were very useful. I actually skipped a lot of lessons because I didn't find them effective- from Linear Algebra in year 1, which I'd learnt before, to Analytics Edge in my last term, because I could watch the videos online at 2x speed. But I enjoyed doing all the projects, and that's where I learnt the most too. Study and forget is one thing, but when I work on a project and figure out & understand what's going on in each part, then I can really internalize this knowledge and remember it for a long time. On hindsight, I think the most important skill I've learnt is how to search for and figure out things I don't know how to do hahaha.

Anyway, the day after my last exam I flew off to Copenhagen with some friends for an almost 3 week trip around Europe. It was super fun!! We saw a lot of grand churches and historical places, but the highlight for me was seeing the Swiss mountains and countryside :D would love to go back to Switzerland again but stay in the countryside and go for more scenic hikes. Most of the cities were really expensive though, meals are easily S$20-30+ unless we cook, which is a lot cheaper but time-consuming. Really makes me grateful for $3 mee pok back home!
