Hello! I'm Si-Yan :)

I'm a software engineer who loves working across the stack, and wants to build impactful products that users love.

I have successfully built and deployed [a nationwide project during Covid-19](/projects/tracetogether-token), delivered high-quality software for clients as part of a [consulting team](/2023/05/31/labs-first-month), and co-founded an [AI startup](https://cartograph.app) that automates software documentation.

I am experienced working in React, Node.js, Python, Java and Kotlin, but I'm also able to pick up new languages and tools quickly to move a project forward. Currently, I am having fun exploring how to use AI tools to build software faster and better (currently using Claude Code the most), and am eager to build impactful AI products.

When not on my laptop, I may be running, baking, travelling and taking photos, or most likely, sleeping.
