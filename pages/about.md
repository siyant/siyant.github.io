Hello! I'm Si-Yan :)

I'm a software engineer who loves building all kinds of things, and believes in using technology to improve people's lives. (That includes automating all the tedious things I'm too lazy to do manually ðŸ˜‚ although I usually end up spending even more time on the task)

My expertise is in frontend development using React, but I'm also able to pick up new languages and tools quickly to move a project forward. Other than JavaScript/TypeScript, I am also proficient in Java and Python, and have dabbled in Flutter, Angular and Ruby on Rails.

I am currently working at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), in the Sensors and Internet of Things team. In this role, I develop software that allows government agencies to use IoT to improve their operations and services to citizens. Notable projects I have played a part in include [Personal Alert Button](/projects/pab) and [TraceTogether Token](/projects/tracetogether-token).

When not on my laptop, I may be running, baking, out taking photos somewhere, or most likely, sleeping.
