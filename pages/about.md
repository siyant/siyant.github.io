Hello! I'm Si-Yan :)

I'm a final-year student at SUTD, studying Information Systems Technology and Design.

My friends sometimes call me a 'robot' because I like math and can think very logically x) I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, and I hope to use my skills to solve real and challenging problems.

I love trying and learning new things! Outside of school, I have done a few projects through which I picked up new languages (eg. JavaScript), frameworks (eg. React, Rails) and skills (eg. graphic design).

When not on my laptop, I'm most likely ~~sleeping,~~ running, baking, or out taking photos somewhere.
